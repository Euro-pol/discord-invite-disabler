# Discord invite disabler  
PoC funny troll website that disables discord invites for a user for an amount of time (a few hours usually). [Click here](https://euro-pol.github.io/discord-invite-disabler/) for a demo üòÅ  

# How does it work?  
Since discord uses cloudflare, they added a rule that blocks someone after spamming requests on the [invite endpoint](https://discord.com/api/v9/invites/nouveau). Therefore, you will see an error when using invites in the discord client. Note that it takes ~1 minute to get rate limited.
