# Discord invite disabler  
PoC funny troll website that disables discord invites for an amount of time (24+ hours usually).  

# How does it work?  
Since discord uses cloudflare, they added a rule that blocks someone after spamming requests on the [invite endpoint](https://discord.com/api/invites/nouveau). Therefore, you will see an error when using invites in the discord client. Note that it takes ~1 minute to get rate limited.
